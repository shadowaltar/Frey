Apple: Bearish Case Keeps Me Bullish For Now

Lately I've started thinking it was about time to unload the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock held in my aggressive model for years now. In previous articles, the focus has swung to concerns about the company missing the phablet market in Asia and the upcoming concern over the emergence of Xiaomi in China. Regardless, the general review has remained that Apple is an incredible brand trading at too cheap of a valuation to sell now. Sure the stock probably isn't going to soar to $150 in the next 12 months, but why not $115 along with a solid dividend?

After reviewing the second quarter numbers and other research reports on Seeking Alpha, I came across a bearish article that actually provided conviction for staying long.
